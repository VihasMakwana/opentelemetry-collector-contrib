subtext: While sending empty data to Splunk with compression enabled, the gzip buffer will be at least 18 bytes (10-byte header + 0-byte payload + 8-byte footer), even if uncompressed data is of 0 bytes. |
HEC will return with '{\\\"text\\\":\\\"No data\\\",\\\"code\\\":5}'' if uncompressed data of 0 bytes is gzipped before sending to HEC. |
The current check in the overall buffer, regardless of compression. So we need to add another check if compression is enabled.
